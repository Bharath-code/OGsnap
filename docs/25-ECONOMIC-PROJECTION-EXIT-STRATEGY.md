---

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | $0 (organic + referral) |
| LTV (Lifetime Value) | $900 (average 3 years) |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | ∞ (no paid marketing) |
| Gross Margin | 95%+ |
| Payback Period | Immediate (no sales cost) |

---

### 5-Year Projection

| Year | MRR | ARR | Notes |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| 1 | $9,000 | $50K | Launch + organic growth |
| 2 | $35,000 | $420K | Framework partnerships + marketplace |
| 3 | $75,000 | $900K | Enterprise tier + data products |
| 4 | $125,000 | $1.5M | Platform moat complete |
| 5 | $175,000 | $2.1M | Market leader |

---

### Profitability Timeline

| Month | Revenue | COGS (10%) | Gross Profit | Runway |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | $85 | $8 | $77 | Profitable |
| 3 | $677 | $68 | $609 | Profitable |
| 6 | $2,335 | $234 | $2,101 | Profitable |
| 12 | $8,900 | $890 | $8,010 | Profitable |

**Verdict: Profitable from Day 1 (Month 1)**

---

## PART 2: Exit Strategy

### Option 1: Bootstrap Forever (Most Likely)

**Why it works:**
- Profitable from month 1
- No VC dilution
- Full control
- Lifestyle business potential

**The Reality:**
- $175K MRR = $2.1M ARR
- Take $500K-1M salary/year
- Sell services around it
- Very comfortable living

**Exit Multiple:** N/A (never sell)

---

### Option 2: Strategic Acquisition

**Who might buy:**

| Potential Acquirer | Rationale | Estimated Value |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vercel | Eliminate OG competitor, add to platform | $2-5M |
| Cloudflare | Add to Workers/R2 ecosystem | $3-6M |
| Netlify | Complete their image offering | $1-3M |
| Cloudinary | Add dynamic OG to their product | $2-4M |
| Shopify | OG for merchant sites | $5-10M |

**What they'd pay:**
- 5-10x ARR
- At $2M ARR → $10-20M potential

**Timeline:** Year 3-5

---

### Option 3: Raise VC (Only If)

**When to raise:**
- Framework partnerships secured (proved distribution)
- $500K+ MRR (proved product-market fit)
- Competitor acquiring similar space

**What you'd give up:**
- 20-25% for $2-5M
- Board seats
- Growth pressure

**Verdict:** Probably not worth it for this business

---

### The Exit Ladder

```
Year 1: Profitable, $50K revenue
    ↓
Year 2: $420K ARR, framework partnerships
    ↓
Year 3: $900K ARR, data moat forming
    ↓
Year 4: $1.5M ARR, strategic interest begins
    ↓
Year 5: $2.1M ARR, acquisition offers OR continue bootstrapping
```
