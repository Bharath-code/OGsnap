## Competitive Response

| Competitor | Response to Magic Onboarding |
|------------|------------------------------|
| @vercel/og | Would need to build scraper, not core competency |
| Vercel | Could add, but not differentiated enough |
| Open source | Would need maintainers to build + maintain |

**Our first-mover advantage:** If we build it well, competitors will be 12-18 months behind.

---

## The Risk

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Extraction fails | Fallback to manual input |
| Brands change | Easy to update brand kit |
| Competitor builds | Speed to market + community |
